# JVM Heap Size Configuration
# =============================
# This setting configures the maximum heap size for the Cassandra JVM.
# Adjust this value based on your workload and available resources.
# For a production environment, consider setting this to a higher value, such as 8G or more.
#
# IMPORTANT: When setting heapSize, ensure that resources.limits.memory is set
# to at least heapSize + 512M to account for off-heap memory, metaspace, direct memory,
# and other JVM overhead. For example:
#   - heapSize: 1024M requires memory limit of at least 1536Mi
#   - heapSize: 4096M requires memory limit of at least 4608Mi
#   - heapSize: 8192M requires memory limit of at least 8704Mi
heapSize: 1024M

# Authentication Configuration for AxonOps Timeseries Database
# =============================================================
# By default, the timeseries database will not have dedicated authentication users for AxonOps.
# It is strongly recommended to configure authentication credentials in production environments.
#
# You have two options for providing authentication credentials:
#
# Option 1: Using a Kubernetes Secret (Recommended for Production)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Provide the name of an existing Kubernetes secret containing the credentials.
# The secret MUST contain these exact keys:
#   - AXONOPS_DB_USER: The database username for AxonOps
#   - AXONOPS_DB_PASSWORD: The database password for AxonOps
#
# Example secret creation:
#   kubectl create secret generic axonops-db-credentials \
#     --from-literal=AXONOPS_DB_USER=axonops \
#     --from-literal=AXONOPS_DB_PASSWORD=secure-password
#
# Then configure:
#   authentication:
#     db_secret: "axonops-db-credentials"
#
# Option 2: Using Direct Values (For Development/Testing Only)
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Provide the username and password directly in the values file.
# Note: This method stores credentials in plain text and should NOT be used in production.
#
# Example configuration:
#   authentication:
#     db_user: "axonops"
#     db_password: "axonops_password"
#
# When Configured:
# ---------------
# The credentials will be passed to the container as environment variables:
# - AXONOPS_DB_USER: The username for database authentication
# - AXONOPS_DB_PASSWORD: The password for database authentication
#
# These environment variables can be used by the application to authenticate with the database.

authentication:
  db_user: ""
  db_password: ""
  db_secret: ""

# Resource Configuration
# =====================
# CRITICAL: Memory limits MUST be higher than the configured heapSize to prevent OOMKilled pods.
# The memory limit should be at least heapSize + 512M to account for:
#   - Off-heap memory (direct buffers, file mappings)
#   - JVM metaspace and code cache
#   - Native memory and thread stacks
#   - Operating system overhead
#
# Default configuration for heapSize: 1024M
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 2000m
    memory: 1536Mi  # heapSize (1024M) + 512M overhead
  requests:
    cpu: 1000m
    memory: 1536Mi  # Same as limits to guarantee pod placement
